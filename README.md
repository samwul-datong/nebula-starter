# Nebula Starter Template

This repo contains a starter template for those new to https://nebula.gl/. 
Nebula does not yet support React 18 and so attempting to add nebula to a new react 18 project produces a lot of errors.
This template can be used as a working starter template until the nebula team is able to provide a stable react 18 release


## Getting Started

`git clone`
`cd nebula-starter`
`yarn && yarn start`
`visit localhost:3000 in your browser`
